There is one combined limit for all of your accounts.Your daily limit remaining and current daily limit are both shown next to the Amount field on the Other Suncorp Bank Account transfers screen, BPAY screen and the External Transfers screen.All transactions to non-Suncorp Bank accounts, to other Suncorp Bank accounts, BPAY transactions and Business Payments are subject to the daily limit. The total of these three types of transactions on any given day must be less than your daily limit. Any transaction that exceeds your daily limit will be rejected.External Transfers and Business Payments require you to enter a Security Token Code to verify the transaction.If two people have access to the same account through Internet banking, then each user will have their own daily limit.Daily limits reset to zero at approximately midnight.Changing Your Daily LimitYou can request changes to your daily limit using the \"Change my daily limit\" link underneath your accounts section in Internet Banking. If you find that the limit is higher than you use, you can request your limit to be lowered.You can change your limit from $0 to $50,000 online via Internet Banking. To change your daily limit over $5,000, you'll need to purchase a Suncorp Bank Security Token.Limits for International Money TransfersThe maximum amount for Online Telegraphic Transfers using the \"Overseas Account\" type can not be changed by altering your daily limit. Subject to your daily limit, the transaction limits for Online Telegraphic Transfers are:Up to AUD $20,000 can be completed 24 hours a day; andTransactions over AUD $20,000 can only be completed during the hours 8.00 am and 6.00pm AEST on any Business Day (being Monday to Friday on which branches of Suncorp Bank are open for business in Brisbane)A single Online Telegraphic Transfer cannot exceed AUD $50,000.The maximum amount that can be transferred within a 48 hour period is AUD $100,000 per Customer ID.Limits for Business AccountsBusiness Account owners can apply for account limits and personal limits to be applied to business accounts. These are subject to approval by us.An\u00a0Account\u00a0Limit limits the total dollar value of all external transfers, BPAY\u00ae, Business Payment Credit files and transfers to another Suncorp Bank account that can be processed from the account each day.A\u00a0Personal\u00a0Limit can be set up for each individual that transacts on the account. It limits the total dollar value of all external transfers, BPAY\u00ae, Business Payment Credit files and transfers to another Suncorp Bank account that the individual can approve each day. Personal limits are only available if an Account Limit is in place.While an account limit or personal limit is in place for an account, the dollar value of external transfers, BPAY\u00ae, Business Payment Credit files and transfers to another Suncorp Bank account made from that account will not be included in the daily limit for the person registered for Internet Banking (e.g.an account limit will override a daily limit).Limits for Business Payments DebitLimits are in place if you're uploading an ABA file to Internet Banking in order to process a business payment debit.A\u00a0Period\u00a0limit restricts the total dollar value of Business Payment Debit files that can be processed for a particular Debit User during a certain period (eg daily, weekly, monthly).A\u00a0File\u00a0limit restricts the total dollar value of an individual Business payment Debit file that can be processed by a particular Debit user.A\u00a0Transaction\u00a0Limit is set for each Debit user and limits each individual transaction that is contained within the Business Payment Debit File.How Daily Limits Affect Future Dated and Recurring\u00a0TransfersFuture dated and recurring payments that are set up to occur on a future and/or recurring\u00a0date, to both Suncorp Bank and non-Suncorp Bank accounts, will affect the daily limit\u00a0on the date the transfer is processed\u00a0and not on the day of set up.For example if you have a future dated transfer that you setup today the first of February for April 15, your daily limit will be deducted overnight on April 15 when the transaction takes place.Business payments reduce the daily limit\u00a0on the date that they are set up\u00a0regardless of the future date of the transaction.The maximum amount for an immediate transfer is your remaining daily limit, and the maximum amount for a future dated transfer is the full amount of your daily limit.If there is an insufficient amount of your daily limit remaining on the date that the transaction actually occurs, the transaction will usually be rejected on that date, and you will receive a notification of the failure by secure message through internet banking.How Daily Limits Affect Two to Sign AccountsWhen a transaction which is subject to a daily limit is set-up under a two to sign authority, the limit will be deducted from the person\u00a0who sets up the transaction. The limit of the person approving the transaction won't be affected.ProfilesProfiles help you group your accounts for more effective Internet banking. For example, you could group your personal accounts in one profile, and have your business accounts in another profile.This way, you only see the accounts that are relevant to a particular group or purpose. If you do not need to group your accounts then the default profile can be used to view all of your accounts.Profiles may also have separate and different email addresses from the original default email addresses provided to further assist you to manage your Internet banking needs.When you first start using Internet banking, you are given a\u00a0default\u00a0profile.You can create up to 10 profiles with a maximum of 20 accounts linked to each profile. An account can be added to more than one profile.Creating a new profileSelect \"Manage My Profiles\" from the green banner on the top of the page.Under\u00a0Create New Profile, enter in a profile name, followed by your preferred primary and secondary email addresses.Click \"Save\" and you have created a new profile. Your new profile has no accounts yet, so you need to go to the next section to add accounts to your profile.If you want to make this your default profile so that the linked accounts appear each time you login, underMaintain Profiles\u00a0click \"Make Default\" in the\u00a0Make Default Profile\u00a0column.Changing the active profileClick the current\u00a0Active Profile\u00a0name at the top of the page.From the drop down list, select the profile you wish to change to.The accounts in use will now be those linked to the profile you have selected.Making a profile the default on loginYou can select which profile is shown automatically when you login into Internet Banking.Select \"My Details\" in the left hand menu then click \"Manage My Profiles\".Locate the profile in the\u00a0Maintain Profiles\u00a0list that you want shown each time you login, click \"Make Default\" under the\u00a0Make Default Profile\u00a0column.Deleting a profileSelect \"My Details\" in the left hand menu then click \"Manage My Profiles\".Locate the profile in the\u00a0Maintain Profiles\u00a0list you wish to delete and click \"Delete\".
